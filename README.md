# Precision-Politics

In this assignment I took a lead role and worked with a group. We had a mock $1.2 million dollar budget for a marketing campaign for a polical candidate. We did some exploratory data analysis in R and tried to focus in on certain target groups instead of blanket advertising through OTT/Video/Banner to anyone identfying as the respective political party.
